# STRIDE: spectrahedral proximal gradient descent along vertices
A Solver for Large-Scale Rank-One Semidefinite Relaxations

## About
STRIDE is designed for solving high-order semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of nonconvex polynomial optimization problems (POPs) that admit rank-one optimal solutions. STRIDE is the first algorithmic framework that blends fast local search on the nonconvex POP with global descent on the convex SDP. Specifically, STRIDE follows a globally convergent trajectory driven by a proximal gradient method (PGM) for solving the SDP, while simultaneously probing long, but safeguarded, rank-one "strides", generated by fast nonlinear programming algorithms on the POP, to seek rapid descent.
